This is a decentralized application (dApp) “The Free Speech Project”. It is based on [the open protocol “Voice”](specification.md), launched on the social [blockchain platform VIZ](https://github.com/VIZ-Blockchain/viz-cpp-node/). Together with microservices responsible for searching, filtering data, storing data and routing messages, the concept of a decentralized social network of backward linking is progressively implemented.

The problems of modern social networks: censorship and filtering of information, the imposition of a social agenda. The formation of news feeds by closed algorithms. We believe that all these problems can be solved and we are moving step by step towards the realization of a free social network protocol.

Using the unique features of VIZ - namely the use of the model of digital social capital through awards - it is possible to digitize not only the context of self-expression, but also to tokenize the relationship between personalities and brands.  VIZ is a turquoise DAO, where each participant can influence the distribution of social capital within the network by rewarding interesting and useful initiatives, seeding a new model of behavior.

## MVP

In the project settings there are parameters responsible for whitelabel, which allows you to run an application instance under a specific brand. For example, a public service is launched under the brand [Readdle.me](https://readdle.me/). Already now it can be used, it is enough to register in the VIZ network and sign in using the usual (regular) private key.
